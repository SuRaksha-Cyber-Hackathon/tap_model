# Tap Model - User Behavior Prediction System 🔮

A sophisticated machine learning system that analyzes user tap patterns and behavior to predict user interactions across different application screens. This project implements a Siamese neural network for one-shot learning and user behavior classification.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed for the **SuRaksha Cyber Hackathon** and focuses on analyzing user interaction patterns to build predictive models for cybersecurity and user authentication applications. The system can identify users based on their unique tap patterns and predict their behavior across different application contexts.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes tap coordinates, duration, and context screens
- **Siamese Neural Network**: Implements one-shot learning for user identification
- **Multi-Screen Support**: Handles various application screens (dashboard, transfer, payments, etc.)
- **TensorFlow Lite Export**: Model optimization for mobile deployment
- **Real-time Prediction**: Fast inference for live user behavior analysis

## 📊 Dataset Features

The system analyzes the following user interaction features:

- **Spatial Coordinates**: X, Y tap positions (normalized)
- **Temporal Data**: Tap duration in milliseconds
- **Context Information**: Application screen context
- **User Identification**: Encoded user IDs
- **Session Grouping**: Aggregated user sessions

### Supported Screen Contexts:
- `RegisterPage`
- `dashboard`
- `transfer_page` 
- `pay_bills`
- `add_funds`
- `profile`
- `statements`
